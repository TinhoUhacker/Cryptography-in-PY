# Cryptography-in-PY
This Python code implements a simple message encryption and decryption program using the cryptography.fernet library. The program allows the user to choose between encrypting a message or decrypting a previously encrypted message. The encryption key is automatically generated and saved together with the encrypted message in a text file.
